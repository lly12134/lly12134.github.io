<p>Experience<br>I am a student at the Faculty of Business Administration of Macau University of Science and Technology. I love to study and participate in various recreational activities, such as watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, watching volleyball matches and traveling.</p>
<p>The most unforgettable experience I have is participating in a study tour organized by AIA in Hong Kong during the summer vacation. It lasted for seven days. I experienced the subway in Hong Kong every morning and learned about some of the financial industry. The reason why it is unforgettable is that during this period, we had a competition between groups on business plans, but because the time given was very short and we had never been exposed to this field, we almost went to bed at three or four o’clock every day during those days and were very tired. But the members of our group were very serious and responsible, and it was warm to think about how we worked hard together. The mentor assigned to our group at that time did not meet with everyone due to physical reasons, so our progress was a little behind other groups. But when she met with us, we could clearly feel her seriousness and responsibility. She could clearly answer all our doubts and questions, provide us with advice, and let us learn a lot of knowledge. With her help, the plan submitted by our group was the most comprehensive and excellent among all the groups. Later, I talked a lot with her and had a certain plan for my future life, which was very rewarding. Maybe she saw the seriousness and hard work of our group, and she privately invited our group members to have a meal after the study tour was over. I still feel happy when I think about it now. Although this experience was tiring, I gained knowledge, friends, and care from my mentor. How can it not be unforgettable?<br><img src="/images/17.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="Hobbies"><a href="#Hobbies" class="headerlink" title="Hobbies"></a>Hobbies</h2><p>About the women’s volleyball game</p>
<p>As early as the 2016 Rio Olympics, I was bored to watch TV, and I happened to see the first game of the Chinese women’s volleyball team. I remember very clearly that it was against the Dutch team, and the Chinese women’s volleyball team was completely defeated, and I didn’t understand the rules of the volleyball game at that time, I only remember that the adults shook their heads again and again. said that the Chinese women’s volleyball team is no longer good. But a few days later, I turned on the TV again, and it happened to be the live broadcast of the women’s volleyball final, but there was a figure of the Chinese women’s volleyball team. I vaguely remember that my mother said before the start of the game that the Chinese women’s volleyball team should be difficult to win, and how the Chinese women’s volleyball team should play with Serbia’s fierce and masculine style of play. But I don’t know why I inexplicably believe that the Chinese team can win, and the result is the same, the Chinese women’s volleyball team finally won the Olympic championship again after many years. At this point, I experienced the charm of competitive sports with an inexplicable sense of happiness in my heart, and I fell in love with watching volleyball games ever since.<img src="/images/6.webp"><br> After that, I watched a lot of games, big and small. Getting to know the different players makes you even more immersed in the charm of volleyball, because it is not a one-person game, but a team sport in which various positions work together. The secondary attack of the iron wall, the main attack of the powerful smash, the strong breakthrough that shocked the four, the wonderful pass of the second setter, and the quick response of the free man all reflect the charm of this game.<br>After graduating from the college entrance examination, I finally had the opportunity to watch the first live women’s volleyball game in my life. The World Women’s Volleyball League held in Hong Kong can only be said to be completely different from what you see on the cold screen, and it is indescribably touching.<img src="/images/7.jpg"><br>In 2024, the World Women’s Volleyball League was still  held in Hong Kong and Macau, so I naturally did not miss this opportunity to come to Macau to watch the game. It’s so memorable again.<img src="/images/8.jpg">And luckily, the reserved seat right in front of me, and the players were sitting in front of me. They gladly agreed to take a photo with them. It’s amazing to see the people who used to be on the screen so kind in front of you.<img src="/images/9.jpg"><br>And there are countless wonderful and glorious moments in competitive sports, which will also accompany these countless sad endings. With the passage of time, there will inevitably be a replacement of the old and the new, and it is also nostalgic and sad to watch familiar players retire one by one. And for those athletes who have strong personal ability, but because the strength of other people in the national team is not good, it is also regrettable. Like Lonneke Sloetjes from the Netherlands, she was a strong response that had a strong impact on me since my time in Rio. The Dutch team also won the highest result in the history of the Dutch women’s volleyball team at that time. However, the state of the players in the team declined seriously, the results of the whole team were not satisfactory, and she retired after a few years. Thinking of a sentence, how can it not be regrettable that the best awards in each event are full, but there is no medal in the three major competitions.<img src="/images/10.jpg"><br>Another player from Serbia is Tijana Bošković, who is my favorite player. From Rio to the present, watching her mature step by step from a genius girl, to a complete world superstar with comprehensive skills, one side of the other, how can you not like it. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, although there was a game at 3 o’clock in the morning, I was still willing to stay up late to watch the game for her, but what I saw was that she was the only attacking point in the whole team, and other attackers could not help her share the offensive pressure at all. As a result, she scored 39 points alone in one game, and the others combined for only 35 points. She can’t win such a game. The talented girl was only 17 years old when she debuted, and now she is 27 years old, how many four years can an athlete have? Watching her miss the Olympic gold medal again, how can she not feel distressed when she sits lonely on the side after the game? “I don’t want to have anything to do with the national team, I just want you to have no regrets” is that I really hope she can win the gold medal, because she deserves it, but volleyball is never a one-man game. Therefore, after struggling and fighting, not only exciting success, but also regret is always the charm of competitive sports.<img src="/images/11.jpg"></p>

<p>About my favorite singers</p>
<p>I love listening to music. I love all kinds of music styles, but I like Taylor Swift’s songs the most.<br>I’ve been a fan of Taylor since I  heard the song You Belong With Me by chance at 11 years old. At that time, it was the period when she was hacked by the whole network, but I still supported her and believed her.<img src="/images/3.jpg"><br>And Taylor is very strong and has not been defeated by overwhelming public opinion. Instead, she made a comeback after three years of silence, released a new album, and public opinion gradually became rational, and her reputation improved.<img src="/images/4.webp"><br>Just like her lyrics “the old Taylor is dead”, she was reborn in nirvana and came out of setbacks to emerge stronger, and that’s what drew me to her deeply. Until 2023, she embarked on a global tour called “The Eras Tour”, whose phenomenal influence cannot be underestimated, and it can be said that there is no one before and since. And I was lucky enough to go to see her concert in Singapore, which was really unforgettable.<img src="/images/5.jpg"><br>Looking back over the years, not only did she bring me marvelous music, but her tenacity and perseverance have always been inspiring, and I think that’s the meaning of idols. “Forever and Always” is the title of one of her songs, and it’s what I want to say to her, hoping that these good things will be eternal.</p>

<p>About video games<br>I like to play all kinds of games, because each different game can bring you different experiences and enrich your spiritual world. The following are some of my favorite games.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>   Baldur’s Gate3<br><img src="/images/13.png"><br>This is the undisputed number one game in my mind, and no other game can give me a better experience than it. This is a DnD group running game, but what makes it different from other games is that it is a work of many years of hard work by the main creative team larian studio. The rich plot, huge world view, detailed map, and vivid characters are unprecedented and unparalleled. The amount of various texts in it is also full. It is really a conscientious masterpiece that is rare in many years. I highly recommend playing it. It is completely irreplaceable.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>   Amerian Aradia<br><img src="/images/14.png"><br>This is a game with an intriguing plot. It is not very well-known, and I discovered it by accident, but it is very memorable. Its setting is a bit like the Truman Show, with various puzzle escape levels, and the accompaniment is full of the flavor of last century disco. It is a very interesting work.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>   Fallout Shelter<br><img src="/images/15.png"><br>This is a classic business game. I played it on iPad when I was very young. At that time, I was always unable to play because of various problems. Residents were invaded without weapons and had no power to fight back, attacked by radioactive monsters, insufficient electricity, etc. But after experiencing countless failures, I summed up my experience, developed productivity and other measures, and made our shelter grow stronger. I think this game not only brought me a sense of accomplishment, but also cultivated my thinking ability.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>4.Valorant<br><img src="/images/16.jpg"><br>This is a 5V5 tactical shooting online game with hero characters as the core. It uses the classic FPS “blasting mode” as the core gameplay. Players will transform into tactical heroes with different skills and use different types of weapons and firearms to participate in the battle. This game is suitable for playing with friends, which can help you maintain relationships or make new friends. As time goes by, your progress in the game will be reflected, giving you a sense of accomplishment.</p>
